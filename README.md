# Baseline results 

With the intention to enable further comparative studies on logic
synthesis in EC, we evaluated the experimental search complex-
ity of the evolutionary design of circuit instances included in our
benchmark suite. The baseline results presented in this section were
obtained with Cartesian Genetic Programming (CGP)
