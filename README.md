# Baseline results 

With the intention to enable further comparative studies on logic
synthesis in EC, we evaluated the experimental search complexity of the evolutionary design of circuit instances included in our
benchmark suite. The baseline results presented in this section were
obtained with Cartesian Genetic Programming (CGP).
